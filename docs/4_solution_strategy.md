# Solution Strategy

## Database Solution

The system will utilize SQLite as the primary database solution during the Proof of Concept (POC) development phase. This decision is based on the following considerations:

- **Rapid prototyping**: SQLite's zero-configuration setup accelerates development cycles  
- **Maintenance simplicity**: Embedded architecture eliminates external database dependencies  
- **Demonstration readiness**: Single-file storage facilitates easy deployment and sharing  

Database schema management will be implemented through migration scripts executed via the `dbmate` tool, with migration triggers initiated programmatically from the application code.

**Implementation Details:**

- Schema management via `dbmate` migration tool with programmatic triggers
- **Circuit breaker pattern** implementation for database operations to (implemented only as a demo, in sqlite scenario it does not make much sense):
  - Prevent cascading failures during database outages
  - Provide graceful fallback mechanisms
  - Automatically recover when services are restored
  - Monitor failure thresholds with configurable trip points

## API Framework Selection

The `Gin Web Framework` has been selected as the foundation for the REST API implementation due to:

- Performance characteristics suitable for the expected workload  
- Established middleware ecosystem
- Proper DTO binding and validation

## Context Propagation

The system will implement custom timeout handling mechanisms to ensure:

- Consistent request context propagation throughout service boundaries  
- Resilient operation under high-latency conditions  
- Graceful degradation during partial system failures  

## Logging Strategy

The zerolog library will be employed to implement structured logging with the following characteristics:

- JSON-formatted output for machine readability  
- Structured key-value pairs for enhanced log analysis  
- Compatibility with modern log aggregation systems
