# Architecture Decisions

## Transaction Handling Implementation

### Status

âœ… Proposed

### Context

The book borrowing service currently executes database operations as discrete, non-atomic writes. This creates potential race conditions during:

- Inventory status updates
- User loan record modifications
- Reservation system changes

### Problem Statement

The existing implementation cannot guarantee data consistency under:

- Concurrent borrowing requests
- System failures during multi-step operations
- Peak load conditions

### Decision

Implement database transaction handling for all borrowing-related operations through:

1. Repository layer transaction support
2. Service-level transaction boundaries
3. Context-aware transaction propagation

### Rationale

| Option            | Pros                  | Cons                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Current Approach  | Simple implementation | Data inconsistency    |
| **Transactions**  | Atomic guarantees     | Development overhead  |


### Follow-up Actions

1. Identify all transactional boundaries
2. Update repository interfaces
3. Implement rollback scenarios
4. Add concurrency tests
